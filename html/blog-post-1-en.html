      <h2>A Relaxed Experience Focused on Helping Others</h2>
      <p>Nordic Race Urban 2024 at Reffen was supposed to be a big moment for me. The plan was to run twice, first completing the race on my own and then helping newcomers to OCR. But two weeks before the race, something unexpected happened – I got a concussion. This put an end to my original ambitions, and I had to adjust to a new situation.</p> 
      
      <h3>A Different Race with a Focus on Helping Others</h3> 
      <p>Instead of going all out with maximum intensity, it became a more relaxed race. I decided to focus on helping other participants who needed support and motivation through their first race. It was a completely different experience than usual – instead of pushing myself to the limit, I got the chance to see the race from a new perspective. It gave me great satisfaction to contribute to others’ success and see them overcome obstacles.</p> 
      
      <h3>Lessons from a Different Challenge</h3> 
      <p>Although it wasn't the physical challenge I had prepared for, I learned a lot from this experience. Stepping back and helping others gave me a new understanding of the OCR community, where it’s not always about your own performance but also about lifting those around you.</p> 
      
      <h3>Looking Forward to 2025</h3> 
      <p>I'm already looking forward to next year, hoping to return with full strength and energy. 2025 will hopefully be the year where I can dive into Nordic Race Urban again and give it everything I've got. Until then, I’ll look back on this unique experience with joy and gratitude for the people I met and helped along the way.</p>
